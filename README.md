# galvanis

Physics-driven falling-block prototype built with TypeScript, Vite, and Matter.js.

You place falling tetrominoes in a continuous world with friction. Conductive pieces can form
a path between the two inner band walls; when that happens, the path flashes and the touched
pieces burn away.
